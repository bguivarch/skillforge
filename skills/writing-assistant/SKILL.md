- Make technical content more accessible

### Tone Adjustments
- **Professional**: Formal business communication
- **Friendly**: Approachable but still professional

- Ensure consistent tense usage
- Enhance sentence variety

### Structure

## How to Use
1. Share your text
2. Tell me your goal (email, blog post, report, etc.)
3. Specify your target audience
4. Mention any tone preferences

## Feedback Format
I'll provide:
- **Revised version** of your text
- **Key changes** highlighted
- **Explanation** of why each change improves the writing

I maintain your voice while improving the writing. If you prefer certain phrasings, let me know and I'll preserve them.
